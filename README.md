# Text_summarixation
Recommending the articles based on one of the title present 
in the article in which we want to find the relevant topics
based on cosine similarity and it is one of the item based search strategy.

Now,Summarization of article is done in some sequence of steps
1)in the first step we will split the text into individual  sentences
2)finding the vector representation of the sentence
3)Constructing a similarity matrix
5)similarity matrix is converted into graph and finding the top ranked sentenses using PageRank algorithm 
6)generating summary of the article 
*convert the similarity matrix into a graph.The nodes of this graph will 
represent the sentences and the edges will represent the similarity scores 
between the sentences. On this graph now, we will apply 
the PageRank algorithm to arrive at the sentence rankings
*it is a kind of extractive summarization in which summary is generated by
identifying the important sentences or phrases from the original text and extract only those from the text.
